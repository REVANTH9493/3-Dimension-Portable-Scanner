### **3 Dimension Portable Scanner**  

#### **Project Overview**  
This project is a **3D scanner** that utilizes **stepper motors, a joystick, an LCD display, and a relay module** to capture multiple images from different angles. The system allows the user to control the position of the scanner using a joystick and navigate through a menu displayed on an **I2C-based 16x2 LCD screen**. The scanning process involves rotating an object using stepper motors and capturing images at different angles. The captured images can be processed later to create a **3D model**.

### **Hardware Components**  
1. **Arduino Board** *(Uno, Mega, or any compatible board)*
2. **Stepper Motors (Two or More)**  
   - One for rotating the object  
   - One for adjusting the position of the camera  
3. **Motor Driver Circuit or Stepper Motor Drivers** *(A4988, ULN2003, or L298N)*
4. **Joystick Module (Analog Joystick)**  
   - Used for navigating through the menu and setting parameters  
5. **LCD Display (16x2, I2C-based)**  
   - Displays setup instructions, scanning progress, and user selections  
6. **Push Button Switches** *(For user inputs like Start/Stop)*
7. **Relay Module** *(To control the camera shutter or external power)*
8. **Power Supply (12V for Motors, 5V for Arduino)**
9. **Camera Module (Optional)**
   - Can be an external camera triggered through serial communication

### **Project Features**  
#### **1. Joystick-Controlled Menu System**  
- The joystick allows users to navigate through different menu options displayed on the LCD.  
- Users can select the number of images to be taken for scanning.  
- The joystick also controls stepper motors to adjust scanning positions.  

#### **2. Stepper Motor-Based Rotation System**  
- The system rotates the object incrementally to capture images from multiple angles.  
- The user can select different rotation resolutions (e.g., 30, 45, or 60 images per 360Â°).  
- A secondary stepper motor is used for vertical movement, allowing for multiple layers of scanning.  

#### **3. Automatic Image Capturing**  
- After every incremental rotation, the system triggers an external camera using a **relay module**.  
- The relay can be used to send a signal to the camera shutter, simulating a button press.  

#### **4. LCD Display with Real-Time Updates**  
- The LCD provides real-time feedback on the scanning process, such as:  
  - Number of images captured  
  - Current position  
  - Motor status  

#### **5. Motor Calibration & Setup**  
- The motors are tested and calibrated before starting the scanning process.  
- The joystick can be used to manually adjust motor positions before scanning begins.  

#### **6. Serial Communication for Camera Control**  
- The system can send serial commands (e.g., "C") to trigger a camera or another system for image capture.

### **Working Process**  

1. **System Initialization**  
   - The LCD displays a welcome message.  
   - The stepper motors perform an initial calibration to check their movement.  

2. **User Input & Configuration**  
   - The user selects the number of images per scan using the joystick.  
   - The joystick can also be used to position the motors manually before scanning.  

3. **Scanning Process**  
   - The stepper motor rotates the object by a small angle.  
   - After each rotation, the relay triggers the camera to capture an image.  
   - If multi-layer scanning is enabled, the vertical stepper motor moves the camera after a full rotation.  
   - The process repeats until all required images are captured.  

4. **Completion & Data Processing**  
   - The system stops once all images are captured.  
   - The captured images can be processed using **3D reconstruction software** to create a 3D model.

### **Possible Enhancements**  
- Adding an **Raspberry Pi & OpenCV** to automatically process images into a 3D model.  
- Replacing the relay-based camera trigger with a **direct USB camera interface**.  
- Using a **higher resolution stepper motor** for more precise scanning.  
- Integrating a **web interface** for remote control.
